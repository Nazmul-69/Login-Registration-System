# Login Registration System
This project implements a secure, fullstack user authentication system using NestJS for both the backend API and server-side rendered frontend. The system allows users to register, log in, and access protected content using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. It integrates with a PostgreSQL database using TypeORM for data management. All user credentials are securely stored with bcrypt hashing, and API routes are protected with authentication guards. This setup provides a scalable foundation for any application requiring user management and secure access control.
